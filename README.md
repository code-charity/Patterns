# List of Patterns üéá 'Pattern-Collector'      
The* ['awesome List'](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#contents) of Patterns        
\*_(there seems to be no other repo yet! So Please edit this draft  wildy üéâ (Spreadsheet & Readme))_ 

Patterns make bite-sized tools & co-work üçøü§èüòé - Searching this list (,once it is well filled,) you did already pre-define the specific scope of your goal, copy pasting this specific portion of thought and thus you will more be more efficient than searching / deciding for NPMs (Node.js packages) or Stack Overflow Answers too. Just like a tweet has a higher density per word than an article.

## 1. **Reg**ular **Ex**pressions(=Search Patterns=Data format definitions.) 
Regex are most common & most efficient to type. (Despite they are one of the oldest dicsiplines in programming to make sense of data, convert it, clean it or spell-check it. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)   
| Common Data Formats¬≤ | efficient pattern for raw data¬≥| *replace / correction*) |
| --: | :-: | :--|  
|ISBN |||

| **Hashes, Public Keys, Signatures** | pattern | *replace* |
| MD6 |||

| **Convert** | pattern | **replace** |
MarkDown links to HTML links |`\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^\)]*)\)`|`<a href="$2">$1</a>`|
`List of Patterns` 2 Javascript |\\\|\`([^\`]\*)\`\\\|\`([^\`]\*)\`\\\||`replace ($1,"$2");`|
Javascript 2 Python | _..(..)..(..)..(..)..(..).._|_$9$7$2$8$4$3_|

*¬≤ date, postal code, formal greeting, formal __, ...* <br> _¬≥ matching typos too, as long as that's still unique / unique enough_

## 1.1 Pre-processing Patterns 
A List of Patterns / Regex can automatically be analyzed for similarities and thus be combined in a preprocessing step. i.e. Preprocessing might Reduce Input data by 90% already in half the time. 

## 1.2 Automatic pattern generation

## 2. Contextual & Semantic patterns 
#### word-lists, topics, frequencies, thesaurus, antonyms,  semantic dictionaries, psychologic & sentiment dictionaries
wordnet, framenet, google ngrams, google trends, ....
#### Google Search: 
~synonyms a|b AROUND(3) c|d  -e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z

#### Human Grammar & Natural language processing (NLP):

## 3. Structured Data. Querying Public Databases & the internet. SPARQL, SQL, NoSQL
#### Semantic web
#### WikiData
#### AWS public databases

## 4. Merging the above "1.-3."
