A List of Patterns / Regex can automatically be analyzed for similarities and thus be combined in a preprocessing step. i.e. Preprocessing might Reduce Input data by 90% already in half the time. 

## 1.2 Automatic pattern generation

## 2. Contextual & Semantic patterns 
#### word-lists, topics, frequencies, thesaurus, antonyms,  semantic dictionaries, psychologic & sentiment dictionaries
wordnet, framenet, google ngrams, google trends, ....
#### Google Search: 
~synonyms a|b AROUND(3) c|d  -e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z
